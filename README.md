# Gait classification using smartphone sensors

I used a simple architecture LSTM network to produce activity classification using raw signals from accelerometer and gyrometer of a smartphone.
This can de used to enchance people mobility

### Visualization of activities for one subject
That might be an error in the processing of raw data since there are many non-labelled sequences. It might be also caused by technical check of the user while doing the record, which are not labelled (something like 'sensor/signal check by operator').

## Training
### Training metrics
  Train/val loss steadily decreasing. Good F1-score (0.926) for such a simple model without additionnal data care (over/under sampling)(normalization off signal was already done by data operator).

### Evaluation
Since we have a high class imbalance, F1 score is more relevant for evaluation than ROC AUC because a high F1 score considers both precision and recall. Higher ROC AUC does not necessarily mean a better classifier in case of class imbalance.
