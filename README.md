# Gait classification using smartphone sensors

I used a simple architecture LSTM network to produce activity classification using raw signals from accelerometer and gyrometer of a smartphone.
This can de used to enchance people mobility
### Raw data processing
### Class content

### Visualization of activities for one subject
That might be an error in the processing of raw data since there are many non-labelled sequences. It might be also caused by technical check of the user while doing the record, which are not labelled (something like 'sensor/signal check by operator').

### Training metrics
  Train/val loss steadily decreasing. Need to cinform the implmentation of fscore / precision / recall.

### Evaluation
Since we have a high class imbalance, F1 score is more relevant for evaluation than ROC AUC because a high F1 score considers both precision and recall. Higher ROC AUC does not necessarily mean a better classifier in case of class imbalance.
