# Gait classification using smartphone sensors

I used a simple architecture LSTM network to produce activity classification using raw signals from accelerometer and gyrometer of a smartphone.
This can de used to enchance people mobility
### Raw data processing
### Visualization of activities for one subject
  + That might be an error in the processing of raw data since there are many non-labelled sequences. It might be also caused by technical check of the user while doing the record, which are not labelled (something like 'sensor/signal check by operator').

### Training metrics
  Train/val loss steadily decreasing. However, Fscore is rather low because of low occurence classes.

### Evaluation
There might be an error in the ROC (to be confirmed). Data imbalance can bee seen in confusion matrix numbers
