# Gait classification using smartphone sensors

I used a simple architecture LSTM network to produce activity classification from XYZ accelerometer and gyrometer raw signals.
### Visualization of activities for one subject
That might be an error in the processing of raw data since there are many non-labelled sequences. It might be aso caused by technical operation done on the user while doing the record, which are not labelled (something like 'sensor/signal check by operator').

### Training metrics
Train/val loss steadily decreasing. However, Fscore is rather low because of low occurence classes.

### Evaluation
There might be an error in the ROC (to be confirmed). Data imbalance can bee seen in confusion matrix numbers
